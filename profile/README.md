# Rubber Duck Cult 🦆

Welcome to the **Rubber Duck Cult**, where we believe in the ancient and powerful art of **Rubber Duck Debugging**! 🦆

## About Us
We are a group of developers who know that sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to explain it out loud… to a rubber duck. Join us as we conquer bugs, code challenges, and late-night development with the wisdom of the duck.

## What We Do
- **Debugging**: When you're stuck, talk it out with the duck.
- **Code Collaboration**: We share knowledge, solutions, and, of course, rubber ducks.
- **Open Source**: We love contributing to the community, one rubber duck at a time.
